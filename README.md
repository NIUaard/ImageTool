# BDplotter
A set of function to load , manipulate and analyze beam-image files. To run the
example:

python tightspot060115.py   demonstrate loding of an image (taken from FAST) and
the dsply of a calibrated picture (with scale representing real space)

python  testprofilefit.py compute projections of an image and fit with Gaussian
distributions

python test_AWA.py take an image and display it (this is a virtual cathode
image) 

TODO:
- implement mouse-based croping
- add desinterlacing function for AWA old camera
