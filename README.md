# ImageTool
A set of function to load , manipulate and analyze beam-image files. To run the
examples:

#### python tightspot060115.py
demonstrates loding of an image (taken from FAST) and
the dsply of a calibrated picture (with scale representing real space)

#### python  testprofilefit.py 
computes projections of an image and fit with Gaussian distributions

#### python test_AWA.py 
takes an image produced by AWA matlab acquisition system and 
displays it (this is a virtual cathode image) 

#### TODO:
- implement mouse-based croping
- add desinterlacing function for AWA old camera
