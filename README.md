# ImageTool
## Synopsis

This package provide a suite of PYTHON functions to faciliatate the analysis 
of digital image commonly acquired from beam density screens (YAG or optical 
transition radiation) in particle accelerators. Special care to background 
substraction and analysis of the image have been implemented as needed to 
derive statistical properties of the beam (size, correlations). 

Some of these functions are used in emittance measurements script based on the 
quadrupole scan techniques. 

## Code Example

not available.


## Tests

executing the command line 
python Analyzebeam.py should produce a plot using data located in the 
data_samples directory.
